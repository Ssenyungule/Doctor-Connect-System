# Preamble
The patient-doctor connect online application is a web-based system that will mainly focus on specialist doctors who cannot be easily accessed without patients first making appointments with them. Patients will be able to make appointments with doctors, order an ambulance, conduct real-time chat and video sessions, rate the doctor’s services and keep patient health information records.
Every single time a user gets to visit a particular doctor, a copy of their medical records is stored in the database and will be available for referral when required.
The system will enable both doctors and patients keep track of their appointments through sending reminders.

# Users
-System Administrator: This one manages the system and has higher system privileges
than other users, they register doctors, update and modify the database.
● Patients: These can browse the system, create accounts, search for available specialists in
line with their health issues, book for an appointment with the doctor, rate the doctor, and
as well can request for real-time chat with preferred doctors.
● Doctors: These can login into their accounts, view the patients that have booked
appointments with them and are able to take action by either approving or rejecting the
pending patient’s appointment.
